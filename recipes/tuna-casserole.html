        <li>12 oz wide egg noodles, uncooked</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 oz) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup (or 1 mushroom and 1 celery)</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To finish:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups frozen peas</li>
        <li>2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on the sauté setting. When hot, add the oil, butter and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion starts to turn translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and dill. stir.</li>
        <li>Add the half and half. Turn off the sauté setting</li>
        <li>Add the egg noodles. Do not stir.</li>
        <li>Add the tuna, spreading evenly over the noodles. Do not stir.</li>
        <li>Add the mushroom soup and spread to cover the noodles. Do not stir.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and set the steam release knob to the sealing position.</li>
        <li>Press the Pressure Cook/Manual button or dial, then the +/- button or dial to select 3 minutes for soft noodles (2 minutes for firmer noodles). High Pressure. The pot will take several minutes to come to pressure.</li>
        <li>When the cook cycle has finished, turn the steam release knob to the Venting position to quick release the steam/pressure. If any soup starts to come out of the steam vent, close it and release the pressure in bursts until the pressure has gone down enough to open it fully.</li>
        <li>When the pin in the lid drops back down, open the lid.</li>
        <li>Carefully take the pot out of the pressure cooker housing and set on a heat safe surface (this keeps it from cooking more).</li>
        <li>Add the peas and give a gentle stir.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese and stir. The casserole will thicken as it cools.</li>
        <li>When the cheese has melted, serve with a sprinkle of parsley as a garnish.</li>
