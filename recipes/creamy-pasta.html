    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A quick and easy pasta dinner in the instant pot. The goat cheese gives it a tangy, tasty kick.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>28 ounce can crushed fire roasted tomatoes (or best quality crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups baby spinach leaves, tightly packed (or chopped spinach)</li>
        <li>8 fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>8 ounces penne pasta (regular, not whole wheat)</li>
        <li>4 ounce goat cheese log</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the following ingredients into the Instant Pot: water, tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, oregano, kosher salt, spinach, whole basil leaves, and penne. Stir until combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes:</strong> Press the Pressure Cook button, making sure the &quot;pHigh Pressure&quot; setting is selected, and set the time. Note that it takes about 10 minutes for the pot to &quot;preheat&quot; and come up to pressure before it starts cooking. (During cooking, avoid touching the metal part of the lid.)</li>
        <li><strong>Quick release:</strong> Vent the remaining steam from the Instant Pot by moving the pressure release handle to &quot;Venting&quot;, covering your hand with a towel or hot pad. Never put your hands or face near the vent when releasing steam. Open the pressure cooker lid</li>
        <li>Open the lid and crumble in the goat cheese; stir until a creamy sauce forms. The sauce will thicken even more as it cools.</li>
    </ol>
